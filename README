README: nlpkit 0.1
============================================================

nlpkit is a collection of command line utillities and Python libraries
intended to helpful in performing natural language processing tasks.

What is an NLP related task, then? In my experience it mostly has to do with feeding picky command line tools with awkwardly formatted input
and then afterwards try to decipher their output. That's at least what nlpkit will help you do.

Although some of the modules in nlpkit fit nicely together, it's not intended as a framework.
There are a few conventions that you'll need to be aware of, though.

Relative paths to data files are resolved through the paths.data_path function, which has certain expectations as to
where your data folder is kept and what it's called. (It expects it to be called 'data'). You can influence the search procedure
through the environment variable NLPKIT_DATA.
